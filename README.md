Delivery #3

#### Delivery description
We try to find minimum and maximum voltages as well as current draw for the parts. This helped us choose a voltage regulator and battery. We created schematics for the custom hardware in our project using Eagle. We will have a custom board for the sensor device and the display device.

We successfully created our git repo for accessing and updating our files.
