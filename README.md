#### System Description
The UV risk detection and alert system is a set of wearable devices that inform the user about UV exposure rate. One device senses UV radiation and the other displays the UV radiation levels. The display device shows the current and average UV index. The display is in the form of two LED bars that ‘fill up’ as exposure increases, and ‘empty’ as exposure decreases. The sensor device can be clipped onto a hat or backpack. The display device is worn on the user’s wrist. The system lets people know when they have experienced a healthy amount of radiation and when their exposure is approaching dangerous levels.
